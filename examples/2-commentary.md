The code blocks are all annoyingly indented because they're in `number` blocks. Ugh.

Followed ChatGPT's directions, got this error (though it mostly seemed ok). Probably something wrong w/ envvars.

```
Uncaught ReferenceError: process is not defined
    <anonymous> main.jsx:6
main.jsx:6:37
    <anonymous> main.jsx:6
```

Ok, I didn't understand that BE code is supposed to be in `convex/*`, not `src/convex`.
